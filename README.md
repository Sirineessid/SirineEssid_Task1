# SirineEssid_Task1
This project detects and counts eye blinks in real-time using video processing and computer vision techniques. It uses the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to identify blinks from a webcam feed or pre-recorded videos. This tool can be applied in areas such as fatigue monitoring for drivers, gaming applications...

# Features
Real-time face and eye detection.
Blink detection based on the EAR (Eye Aspect Ratio).
Accurate blink counting over a defined period.
Supports both live webcam feeds and video files.
## What are facial landmarks that dlib detects:
The dlib library can be used to detect a face in an image and then find 68 facial landmarks on the detected face.

## Our Use Case :
Each eye is represented using 6 landmarks points:

## EAR 
This method is very simple, efficient, and doesnâ€™t require anything like image processing. Basically, this ratio gives us a certain relation between the horizontal and vertical measurements of the eye. This is the equation to calculate the EAR using the six parameters of the eye :
